    or some other tensor type. Complex types (which have a .child attribute) need to
    have arguments converted from the arg to arg.child so that the types match as the
    method is being called down the chain. To make this efficient, we cache which args
    need to be replaced with their children in a dictionary called
    hook_method_args_functions. However, sometimes an method (an attr) has multiple
    different argument signatures, such that sometimes arguments have .child objects
    and other times they don't (such as x.div(), which can accept either a tensor or a
    float as an argument). This invalidates the cache, so we need to have a try/except
